# How to get started
## Azure DevOps Services

Navigate to your work item form customization page and add a multivalue control.

![Layout Customization](img/layoutCustomization.png)

Edit the control so it can use the right field to store your selection and the right set of values to be displayed.

![Options](img/options.png)

Be sure to allow user inputed values if a picklisk (string) field is used to back the extension.

![check the box to allow users to enter their own values](img/allowedValues.png)

## Azure DevOps Server
We recommend TFS 2017 RC2 or later when running this extension.

[Learn more](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-extension-multivalue-control/blob/master/xmldetails.md) about how to customize the multivalue control directly on XML.

# How to query

The selected values are stored in a semicolon separated format.  To search for items that have a specific value use the "Contains Words" operator.  If searching for multiple values, use multipe "Contains Words" clauses for that field.
